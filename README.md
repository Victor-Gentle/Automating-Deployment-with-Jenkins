# Automating Deployment of an E-commerce Website Using Jenkins with Docker
This README provides a comprehensive guide to automate the deployment of an E-commerce website using Jenkins with Docker. It covers the installation of Jenkins, configuration of plugins, security measures, integration with a version control system (Git), setting up webhooks in GitHub, configuration of freestyle jobs, creation of pipeline jobs and scripts, Docker image creation, running containers, and pushing images.

## 1. Jenkins Installation and Configuration
### Step 1: Jenkins Installation

- Install Jenkins on your preferred server environment.
- Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed.
- Follow the official Jenkins installation guide for your operating system.
### Step 2: Plugin Installation and Configuration

- Access Jenkins dashboard.
- Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Plugins".
- Install necessary plugins:
   - Docker Pipeline Plugin
Configure plugins as required for your project.
### Step 3: Security Measures

- Enable authentication and authorization.
- Use HTTPS to secure communication.
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Regularly update Jenkins and plugins.
- Continuously monitor the server for security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Integration with Version Control System (Git) and Setting Webhooks (GitHub)
### Step 1: Integration with Git

- Install Git on Jenkins server if not already installed.
- Configure Jenkins to integrate with Git:
- Navigate to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System".
- Under "Git" section, specify Git executable path and configurations.
### Step 2: Setting Webhooks in GitHub

- Log in to GitHub and navigate to repository settings.
- Go to "Webhooks" -> "Add webhook".
- Enter Jenkins server URL followed by /github-webhook/.
- Set content type to application/json.
- Select events to trigger webhook (e.g., push).
- Add webhook.

## 3. Configuration of Freestyle Job
- Create a new freestyle job in Jenkins.
- Configure source code management to use Git.
- Specify build steps and post-build actions as needed.
- Save the job configuration.

## 4. Creation of Pipeline Job and Pipeline Script
- Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
- Write a pipeline script in Jenkinsfile (Check Jenkinsfile at main)
- Save the pipeline script in your project repository.

## 5. Docker Image Creation and Management
- Write a Dockerfile in the root of your project (Check Dockerfile at main)
- Build Docker image using 'docker build' command.
- Run Docker container using 'docker run' command.
- Push Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub) using docker push command.

The docker commands will be incorporated in the Jenkinsfile

## 6. Conclusion
By following this guide, you have successfully automated the deployment of your E-commerce website using Jenkins with Docker. Jenkins is now integrated with your version control system, configured with freestyle and pipeline jobs, and capable of building, testing, and deploying your application automatically. Ensure to regularly maintain and update your Jenkins server, plugins, and Docker images to ensure a smooth and secure deployment process.
